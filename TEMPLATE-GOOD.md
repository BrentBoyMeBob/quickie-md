# Title
Explain your project in one or two small sentences. Avoid writing long and complicated subjects. 

## Instructions
1. Keep it extremely clear.
2. Do not skip any steps or half-ass any of them.
3. But to keep it more organized, you can combine steps together, resulting in less lines.
4. Each step should only be one sentence long, keep it simple.
5. If it is unnecessary to have steps, feel free to write a paragraph consisting of up to 3 clear and concise sentences.

## Screenshots
(Add up to 3 screenshots here optionally, and make sure they are detailed and describe what the program is about. Do not add logos or anything that is unnecessary to functionality.)

## Extra Sections
The above is all you need for a concise and clear README. But, if necessary, add up to 3 more sections here. Limit them to one or two paragraphs, in this case, 4 sentences each. As long as you keep it minimal, add anything you'd like, such as tables, to-do lists, or any sort of data.
